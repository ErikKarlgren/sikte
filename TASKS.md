# Tasks
- [x] Make cli accept mandatory PID
- [x] Make ebpf program always filter by PID
- [x] Show syscalls (sys enter and exit) for PIDs given
- [x] Execute commands and track their syscalls
- [x] Map syscall IDs to their names (userspace?)
- [x] Calculate time spent per syscall
- [x] Print time spent per syscall
- [ ] Add a syscall filter using array. Should work for x64, arm, ...
- [ ] Make command not start immediately so as to ensure we're tracking all of its syscalls and not lose some information at the beginning (it can send a sigstop signal to self)
- [ ] Fix ctrl-c bug: if command has finished, i shouldn't need to press ctrl-c
